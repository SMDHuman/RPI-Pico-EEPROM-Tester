# RPI-Pico-EEPROM-Tester
This project's purpose is to test 28C256 EEPROM chips integrity. It fills all the addresses with random set of values and then read it again to control if all the values are the same as the original random value set. Wiring can be differs with circumstances but in any time all the GP pins of Raspberry pi Pico is used in this process.
